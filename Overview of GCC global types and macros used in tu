Overview of GCC global types and macros used in tutorial.
---------------------------------------------------------

DECL_IS_BUILTIN - 

This just focuses in on the file being compiled and ignores the GCC AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) implicit declarations for RTTI, exceptions, and static construction/destruction support code and compiler builtin declarations.

PLUGIN_FINISH_UNIT - 

PLUGIN_OVERRIDE_GATE - 

Event which will allow you to see all the passes that are being executed. This is called before every pass.

HOST_BIT_BUCKET -

Is defined as "/dev/null"

error_count -

Number of compilation errors

main_input_filename -

Name of the file being compiled

global_namespace -

The root of the AST

tree_code_name -

Is an array of strings containing human-readable tree code names

TYPE_DECL -

type declaration

VAR_DECL -

variable declaration

ARRAY_TYPE -

array type 

RECORD_TYPE - 

class/struct type

TREE_CHAIN -

Macro that transverses the tree nodes, which are linked together by a linked list

DECL_NAME -

Declaration names

IDENTIFIER_NODE -

Retrieves the node type

TREE_TYPE -

Returns the tree node (with one of the *_TYPE tree codes) corresponding to the type of entity being declared

DECL_SOURCE_FILE - 

Returns the file name of the declaration source

DECL_SOURCE_LINE -

Returns the line number of the declaration source.

cp_namespace_decls - 

Returns declartions from namespaces

cp_binding_level -

Includes nested namespaces

location_t -

Storing file/line/column information with each tree node would require too much memory so instead GCC stores an instance of the location_t type (currently defined as unsigned int) in tree nodes. The location_t values consist of three bit-fields: the index into the line map, line offset, and column number.

CP_DECL_CONTEXT - 

Recreates the original namespace hierarchy, the namespace information is inferred from declaration nodes.
